# turismochaniar
This website was created in 2020, it was one of my first projects.
It was made with Javascript.
It was designed for a tourism company with an older audience in mind. Institutional colors, visual appeal and ease for use were taken into account.
This website has two carrousels, one for pictures and the other one for client's opinion. It also has two parallax effects, one in the banner at the begining and the other one in the contact form background.


--At that time I did not use to much GitHub and now when I prepared this for my new portfolio I realised all I improved. I am proud of myself.--
